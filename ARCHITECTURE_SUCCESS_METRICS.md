## üìà Measurement Tools & Dashboards

### **Integrated Monitoring Stack**
1. **Consciousness Dashboard:** Custom React app for all metrics.
   ```typescript
   // dashboards/MetricsDashboard.tsx
   export function MetricsDashboard() {
     const [technical, business, innovation, dev] = useFetchMetrics();
     
     return (
       <div>
         <TechnicalMetrics metrics={technical} />
         <BusinessKPIs kpis={business} />
         <InnovationScore score={innovation} />
         <DevExperience devMetrics={dev} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **External Tools:**
   - **Datadog:** Technical performance.
   - **Google Analytics:** Business metrics.
