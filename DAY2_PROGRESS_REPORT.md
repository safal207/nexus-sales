## ⏳ **TRACK B: BACKEND (KIMI-K2) - IN PROGRESS**

### Status: 🟡 **PENDING / IN PROGRESS**

### Mission: PostgreSQL Database Migration

### Expected Deliverables:
```
□ PostgreSQL installed (local + Supabase)
□ Prisma schema created
□ Migrations generated
□ Repository classes implemented
□ Auth APIs migrated to PostgreSQL
□ Products APIs migrated to PostgreSQL
□ Tests updated and passing

Phase 3 (13:00-14:30): Mock → PostgreSQL migration
Phase 4 (14:30-16:00): Testing & validation
Phase 5 (16:00-17:30): Documentation
```

### What GPT-5 High Needs:
```
⚠️ BLOCKER: Need DATABASE_URL for Vercel deployment
→ Kimi-k2 will provide Supabase connection string
→ Required format:
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

□ Auth flow tests (login, register, logout)
□ Product management tests (CRUD)
□ Checkout flow tests
□ All tests passing
□ Documentation created
```

### Mission 3: Redis Evaluation (20%)
```
□ Current caching analyzed
□ Redis use cases evaluated
□ Cost-benefit analysis
□ Recommendation: NO for MVP ✅ (expected)
□ Future implementation plan

□ AUTO_TESTS_STATUS.md created
```

### Timeline (from briefing):
```
09:00-10:00: Component audit
10:00-12:00: Build core UI components
13:00-14:00: Integrate components
14:00-15:00: Playwright setup

## 🎯 **OVERALL DAY 2 PROGRESS**

### Completed: 1/3 Tracks ✅

```
✅ Track D (Infrastructure): 100% DONE
⏳ Track B (Backend): In Progress
⏳ Track C (Frontend): In Progress
```

### Critical Path Analysis:

```
BLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS:

Vercel Deploy (User) → Needs DATABASE_URL from Kimi-k2
├─ Can deploy without DB, but won't work
└─ Should wait for Kimi-k2 to finish

Qwen E2E Tests → Should work with Kimi-k2's PostgreSQL
├─ Can write tests with Mock DB first
└─ Better to wait for real DB

GPT-5 High → ✅ NO BLOCKERS, FINISHED!
```

### Risk Assessment:

```
🟢 LOW RISK:
- CI/CD pipeline working
- Documentation complete
- Vercel setup clear

🟡 MEDIUM RISK:
- Database migration (complex, needs testing)
- E2E tests (need stable DB)

🔴 NO HIGH RISKS IDENTIFIED
```

---

## 📋 **NEXT ACTIONS**

### Immediate (Now):

```
1. ✅ Update team on GPT-5 High completion
2. ⏳ Monitor Kimi-k2 progress (PostgreSQL)
3. ⏳ Monitor Qwen progress (UI + Tests)
4. ⏳ Prepare for integration when Kimi-k2 finishes
```

### When Kimi-k2 Completes:

```
1. Get Supabase DATABASE_URL
2. Add to Vercel environment variables
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Test production deployment
5. Verify database connection works
6. Run Qwen's E2E tests against production
```

### EOD Day 2 Demo (17:30):

✅ Production deployment on Vercel
✅ E2E tests passing
✅ UI components polished
✅ Redis evaluation complete

✅ All 3 tracks complete
✅ Production deployment live
✅ Database migrated
✅ Tests passing
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Team demo successful

Confidence: 🟢 HIGH (85%)
```

### Potential Delays:

```
