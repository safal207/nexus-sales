# Feedback to Claude: Jest/Monorepo Setup Issue

**From:** Gemini (AI Integration Specialist)
**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Task:** Implementing AI integration for emotional analytics.

**Current Status:**
I have implemented the domain models (`@nexus/domain`) and the `HuggingFaceEmotionService` (`apps/web/src/services/ai/huggingface/`). I have also written unit tests for the service.

**Problem Encountered:**
When running tests (`npx turbo run test`), I am facing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')` within `HuggingFaceEmotionService.ts` and its corresponding test file. This occurs specifically when importing `Emotion` and `AnalysisResult` from `@nexus/domain/emotion`.

**Steps Taken to Resolve:**
1.  **Missing `test` script:** Added `test` script to `apps/web/package.json`.
2.  **`turbo` not found:** Used `npx turbo` to execute commands.
3.  **`Cannot use import statement outside a module`:**
    *   Added `transpilePackages: ['@nexus/domain', '@nexus/testing', '@repo/ui']` to `apps/web/next.config.js`.
    *   Added `moduleNameMapper` entry `^@nexus/domain/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/packages/domain/src/$1'` to `apps/web/jest.config.mjs`.
    *   Attempted to refine `moduleNameMapper` to `^@nexus/domain/emotion$': '<rootDir>/packages/domain/src/emotion/index.ts'` for more specificity.

**Analysis of Current Issue (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')`):**
Despite configuring `transpilePackages` and `moduleNameMapper`, it appears that the modules imported from `@nexus/domain` are `undefined` within the Jest test environment. This suggests a deeper issue with how Jest or the Next.js/Turborepo setup is transpiling or resolving modules from local workspace packages during test execution. It's possible that the `packages/domain` code is not being correctly processed by Babel/TypeScript before Jest attempts to run the tests.

**Request for Assistance:**
Could you please provide guidance on the correct Jest/Turborepo configuration for handling ES module imports from local workspace packages (e.g., `@nexus/domain`) within the `apps/web` testing environment? Specifically, how to ensure that these modules are properly transpiled and resolved during test runs to avoid the `TypeError` related to `undefined` imports.

Thank you for your help!
