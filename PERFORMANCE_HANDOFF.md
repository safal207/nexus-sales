# GPT-5 High â†’ CodexAI: Performance Handoff

Date: 2025-09-29
Owner: GPT-5 High (Performance Optimization Specialist)

## Summary

Stage 4/7 completed with a production-ready optimization baseline across client, API, and CI/build infra.

## Implemented Optimizations

1) HuggingFace Emotion Service (server)
- server-only to exclude from client bundle
- TTL cache (default 60s) + de-dup concurrent requests
- Request timeout via AbortController (default 2.5s)
- File: apps/web/src/services/ai/huggingface/HuggingFaceEmotionService.ts

2) Bundle/Code Splitting (client)
- Dynamic imports for Recharts + `ssr: false`
- Next.js `experimental.optimizePackageImports: ['recharts']`
- Files:
  - apps/web/src/components/analytics/PredictiveAnalytics.tsx
  - apps/web/src/components/analytics/EmotionalJourneyChart.tsx
  - apps/web/next.config.js

3) React Hot-Path
- useCallback handlers + useMemo chart data, React.memo wrappers
- Files:
  - PredictiveAnalytics.tsx
  - EmotionalJourneyChart.tsx

4) API Caching (<200ms target on repeated hits)
- In-memory per-user cache (15s TTL) for hot GET endpoints
- Files:
  - apps/web/src/app/api/analytics/insights/route.ts
  - apps/web/src/app/api/emotions/analyze/route.ts (GET)

5) Build Time & CI
- turbo.json inputs/outputs/env/globalDependencies tuned
- Next.js: `swcMinify: true`, `productionBrowserSourceMaps: false`
- GitHub Actions CI with Turbo cache support
- Files:
  - turbo.json
  - apps/web/next.config.js
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml

## Package Outputs Unification

- packages/ui: add build script + tsconfig outDir `dist/`
- packages/domain, packages/testing: no-op build (compiled by Next.js transpilePackages), added `check-types`

## How to Validate

1) Local
- Run build: `npm run build` (root)
- Launch web: `npm run dev -w apps/web`
- Navigate analytics pages; verify charts lazy-load and UI is responsive.

2) API
- Hit `/api/analytics/insights` twice; second call should be a cache hit (<200ms locally)
- Hit `/api/emotions/analyze` (GET) twice; second call should be a cache hit as well

3) CI
- Push to a branch; inspect CI logs in GitHub Actions
- If available, set `TURBO_TEAM` and `TURBO_TOKEN` secrets for remote cache

## Metrics (to collect during validation)
- Build time (before/after) and cache hit ratio (Turbo)
- Initial bundle size for analytics route (before/after)
- FCP/LCP changes on analytics pages (local Lighthouse)
- API p50/p95 response for cached endpoints (insights, emotions history)

## Next Suggestions (CodexAI)
- Extend memoization to other heavy components if needed
- Add a simple compression middleware (if platform allows) for analytics JSON
- Consider moving in-memory cache to Redis in production if multi-instance
- Ensure ESLint warnings kept low; wire into CI as a required check when stable

## Notes
- All changes are additive and backwards compatible
- Caches have conservative TTL and are per-user to avoid data leakage
